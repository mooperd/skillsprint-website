      <p class="thumb-cta__text">
        The first step in adopting any technology should be to define the first business impact that this technology should have. 
        The MVP should affect the work of at least one permanent employee - hopefully for the better. It is important that something actually changes for the MVP to be successful. 
        There are no "Proof Of Concepts" here.
