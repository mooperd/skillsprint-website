    	The development of technology and technical skills is a collaborative, social process. Supporting high quality social interactions is essential part of any engineers work. Successful technology teams often employ techniques such as Pair Programming - where two developers work together on a single computer - to ensure that new knowledge is not siloed within a single team member. Pair programming also dramatically increases the quality of the knoweldge generated by reinforcing the social interaction and the quality of the engineering by applying more than one brain to the problem.

    	A Skill Sprint consists of many pair programming sessions. It is the job of the Captain to ensure that the participants are switching the roles of "Driver" and "Navigator" regularly. The Captain will have to encourage people to pair as much as possibe - providing hints, guidence and encouragement - backing off and providing space as much as possible.

    	The Captain provides specific best practices and pattern guidance while the Navigator and Drivers code and build.
